    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy outlines how Cowboy Toad Games LTD ("we," "us," or "our") handles your data, how it may be
        used, and the limited circumstances under which it might be processed when you interact with our games, website,
        and related services.
    </p>

    <h2>1. No Active Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        We design our games with privacy in mind. None of our games actively collect, track, or transmit any personal
        information. Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect personal data such as your name, email address, IP address, or payment information.</li>
        <li>We do not use cookies, analytics, advertising identifiers, or tracking technologies within our games.</li>
        <li>We do not transmit gameplay data, preferences, or personal identifiers to our servers or any third party.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Limited Data Handling</h2>
    <p>
        While our games themselves do not collect data, some limited usage data may be processed through the third-party
        services we rely on:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Cloudflare Analytics:</strong> Our website uses <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare Analytics</a> to monitor traffic and performance. This service
            uses anonymized data to help improve security and site reliability. We do not use Cloudflare to collect
            personal information or track users across sites.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Steam Cloud:</strong> If you play our games via Steam, save game data may be stored through Steam
            Cloud. We do not access or store this data directly. Please refer to the <a
                href="https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Privacy
                Policy</a> for more information.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Platforms</h2>
    <p>
        Our games may be downloaded and played through third-party platforms, each of which may collect and process data
        under their own privacy practices. These platforms include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam (Valve
                Corporation)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple App Store (Apple
                Inc.)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play Store (Google
                LLC)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any platform through which you access our games, as we do not
        control the data collection practices of these services.
    </p>

        updates.
